This repository contains a MATLAB Live Script demonstrating the use of MATLAB's Color Thresholder tool for segmenting red peppers from the 'peppers.png' image. Please note that the Color Thresholder did not function in the online version of MATLAB, so the experiment was conducted using the desktop version. The script provides a simple and effective example of image segmentation using the RGB color space.
